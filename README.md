A complete overhaul of my initial portfolio using Webflow.

Webflow is a great design tool and I would not have been able to create my portfolio without it. The only issue I noticed was it lacked accessibility tags throughout. I went through and added figure and figcaptions throughout to make the website more accessible to everyone. I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed creating it.

Thank you.
