        <h3 class="case-study-h3">Problem with Initial Version:</h3>
        <p class="paragraph-text">When I completed my apprenticeship at Bloc I was extremely proud of all the progress I had made in my UX journey. I had finished two projects I was proud of, and learned so much in my time there. However, my way of showcasing these projects was underwhelming.<br></p>
        <p class="paragraph-text next-paragraph">In order to pass the course, I needed to design and code a portfolio using purely HTML5 and CSS. This was a massive undertaking for me as I have never coded anything in my life. Let me tell you, I never thought I would finish it and it proved to test my patience on many occasions. When finished, I had a portfolio I was proud of, but was not in love with. It felt clunky and was riddled with small bugs that made the whole experience pretty uninspired.</p>
        <p class="paragraph-text next-paragraph">When I initially designed my original portfolio, I was only about half way through my apprenticeship. I designed things to “fit in” with what others were doing. I wanted a minimalist design that took up 100% of the view port because I saw it used on other people’s websites. I thought this was “The future” but boy was I wrong. In reality this design choice did not work. I made a promise to myself at this point.</p>
      </article>
      <article class="retro-emphasis-container-copy w-container">
        <p class="paragraph-text emphasis">When I finish this course, I am going to recreate my portfolio from the ground up and create something that truly embodies <span class="text-span-5"><em>me</em></span>.</p>
      </article>
      <article class="follow-up-container retro-follow-up w-container">
        <h3 class="case-study-h3">Reason for this Design:</h3>
        <p class="paragraph-text">I love the idea of the 1970’s. Movies like Anchorman, Almost Famous, and Dazed and Confused have always held a place in my heart. I love the colors palettes, the music, the vibe and more. Rather than trying to design to fit in, I wanted to create something unique to me. My portfolio is the one place where I am supposed to showcase myself so why not create something modern, but with a 1970’s twist. Thus the Retrolio, (Retro Portfolio) was created</p>
      </article>
      <article class="follow-up-container w-container">
        <h3 class="case-study-h3">Goals For Rework:</h3>
        <p class="paragraph-text">My goals were simple. I know I am not the best coder in the world, but I wanted to create a website that looked awesome without using SquareSpace or Wix. One day while watching UX tutorial videos on YouTube, I came across a creator called “Flux” who used a service called <a href="http://www.webflow.com" target="_blank" class="webflow-link"><strong class="bold-text">Webflow </strong></a>to create websites for his clients. I decided this was the answer to my issues.</p>
        <p class="paragraph-text next-paragraph">It is essentially a service where you create websites literally by designing them. You still use components you would in html such as div’s, containers, links, etc. However, you design them in what they call the “Designer.”</p>
        <p class="paragraph-text next-paragraph">This was a great opportunity to not only create a better portfolio, but to learn a brand new skill. I figured I have learned how to use designing services, such as Figma, and recently taught myself how to code, so there is no reason why I couldn’t use Webflow. This proved to be more difficult than I thought; however, it was a fantastic learning experience that I am glad I pursued.</p>
        <p class="paragraph-text next-paragraph last-paragraph">Below are the major changes of the update, and I hope you enjoy it.</p><a href="https://careik.github.io/Portfolio/" target="_blank" class="case-study-button us-padding w-button">Initial Portfolio</a></article>

      <article class="first-title-container w-container">
        <h3 class="case-study-h3">Homepage:</h3>
        <p class="paragraph-text">One of the last things a mentor of mine at Bloc said was to showcase my “superpowers.” That was helpful advice and why I added a small section on the landing page describing what I am interested in doing.</p>
        <p class="paragraph-text next-paragraph">Next, I had issues with resizing on mobile devices due to the 100vh containers I used. On mobile devices the homepage looked great on an iPhone X, but terrible on a device like the iPhone SE. If someone looked at my website on a smaller screen size, they would have immediately closed the window and moved on to the next person.</p>
        <p class="paragraph-text next-paragraph last-paragraph">Lastly, the color palette needed to change. This affected my entire portfolio, but it is most prevalent on the homepage. My color scheme in my original was black and white. There was no life to it and even I, the creator, did not get excited for it. I spent a long time thinking about what color choices I wanted to use which is where I came across the idea for the 1970’s twist. This added life back to my portfolio and made it interesting. It actually gets me eager to scroll through it as opposed to the initial version. As for you, I guess you will have to let me know.</p>

        <p class="paragraph-text">With my original portfolio, it was a pretty <span class="text-span-6">un-event-ful</span> (get it?) experience. There was no JavaScript and the page felt unlively. The best action would be a button color change on hover. Luckily, with Webflow, I figured out how to add small animations that truly brought my portfolio to life. Although this does not add much in the form of content, it helps keep the page feeling fresh and alive.</p>

      <h2 class="h2 cs-section white-font">Conclusion</h2>
      <article class="first-title-container white-font w-container">
        <p class="paragraph-text">As I said in the beginning, I am extremely proud of my original portfolio. When creating it I set out on a journey to figure out how to code in HTML and CSS and I would consider it a success. Without the knowledge gained from this, I would have never been able to redesign my portfolio using Webflow. Webflow requires that you understand the foundations of HTML and CSS to be able to build within its designer.</p>
        <p class="paragraph-text next-paragraph">Building this portfolio was some of the most fun I have had. I now get to look back at my original and physically see how much I have improved. This is now a portfolio I am proud of and truly expresses something meaningful to me.</p>
