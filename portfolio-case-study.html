      <article class="first-title-container w-container">
        <h3 class="case-study-h3">Problem with Initial Version:</h3>
        <p class="paragraph-text">When I completed my apprenticeship at Bloc, I was extremely proud of the progress I made in my UX journey. I completed two projects I was proud of, and learned so much from my assignments. However, my way of
          showcasing these projects in my portfolio was underwhelming.<br></p>
        <p class="paragraph-text next-paragraph">Bloc required that I design and code my portfolio using purely HTML5 and CSS. This was a massive undertaking because I had never coded anything in my life. To tell you the truth, I doubted if I would
          finish it and it tested my patience on many occasions. When I finally finished, I had a portfolio I was satisfied with, but did not love. It felt clunky and was riddled with small bugs that made the whole experience uninspiring.</p>
        <p class="paragraph-text next-paragraph last-paragraph">When I began designing my original portfolio, I was only about half way through my apprenticeship. I designed my portfolio to fit in with what I saw other designers doing. I wanted a
          minimalist design that took up 100% of the view port because I saw it used on other people’s websites. I thought this was futuristic, but wow was I wrong. In reality, this design choice did not work. In that moment I made a promise to
          myself.</p>
      </article>
      <article class="retro-emphasis-container-copy w-container">
        <p class="paragraph-text emphasis">When I finish this course, I am going to recreate my portfolio from the ground up and create something that truly embodies <span class="text-span-5"><em>me</em></span>.</p>
      </article>
      <article class="follow-up-container retro-follow-up w-container">
        <h3 class="case-study-h3">Reason for this Design:</h3>
        <p class="paragraph-text">I love the style of the 1970’s. Movies like Anchorman, Almost Famous, and Dazed and Confused have always held a place in my heart. I love the colors palettes, the music, and the relaxed vibe. Rather than designing to
          fit in, I wanted to create something unique to me. My portfolio is the one place where I am supposed to showcase myself, so I decided to create something modern, but with a 1970’s twist. Soon, the Retrolio (Retro Portfolio) was born.</p>
      </article>
      <article class="follow-up-container w-container">
        <h3 class="case-study-h3">Goals For Rework:</h3>
        <p class="paragraph-text">My goals were simple. I know I am not the most experienced coder, but I wanted to create a website that looked awesome without using SquareSpace or Wix. While watching UX tutorial videos on YouTube, I came across a
          creator called Flux who used a service called <a href="http://www.webflow.com" target="_blank" class="webflow-link"><strong class="bold-text">Webflow </strong></a>to create websites for his clients. I decided this was the answer to my
          issues.</p>
        <p class="paragraph-text next-paragraph">Webflow is a service where you create the front-end design of a website, and Webflow generates the code for your design. You create the front-end design using a feature called the Designer. </p>
        <p class="paragraph-text next-paragraph">This was a great opportunity to create a better portfolio and learn a new skill. Through my apprenticeship, I learned how to use designing services like Figma, and I recently taught myself how to code,
          so I felt confident learning a new design platform like Webflow. This proved to be more difficult than I thought; however, it was a fantastic learning experience that I am glad I pursued.</p>
        <p class="paragraph-text next-paragraph last-paragraph">Below are the major upgrades to my portfolio. I hope you enjoy. </p><a href="https://careik.github.io/Portfolio/" target="_blank"

      <article class="first-title-container w-container">
        <h3 class="case-study-h3">Homepage:</h3>
        <p class="paragraph-text">A mentor of mine at Bloc said to showcase my &quot;superpowers&quot; in my portfolio. This advice inspired me to add a small section on the landing page describing what I am interested in doing.</p>
        <p class="paragraph-text next-paragraph">Next, I had issues with resizing on mobile devices due to the 100vh containers I used. The homepage looked great on an iPhone X, but terrible on a device like the iPhone SE. If a potential employer or
          client viewed my portfolio on a smaller screen device, they would have immediately closed the window and moved on to the next candidate.</p>
        <p class="paragraph-text next-paragraph last-paragraph-port">Lastly, the color palette needed to change. This affected my entire portfolio, but it was most prevalent on the homepage. The color scheme in my original portfolio was black and
          white. There was no life to it and even I, the creator, did not get excited for it. I spent a long time contemplating what color choices I wanted to use. Eventually, I fell on the idea of some 1970’s flair. This added life and personality
          to my portfolio. I am excited as I scroll through my Retrolio as opposed to the initial version. As for you, I guess you will have to let me know.</p>
