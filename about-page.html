          <h3 class="h3 follow-up-heading about-padding">The beginning</h3>
          <p class="paragraph-text">As a kid, I loved creating custom backgrounds for my desktop. I would spend hours cutting photos from Google Images and pasting them into Microsoft Paint, adding shapes, changing colors, and editing them to match
            my vision. I always enjoyed this creative outlet but never considered it a career option.  </p>
          <p class="paragraph-text next-paragraph">On the other hand, I love science. I studied Biology in college and was hired to work for a pharmaceutical company shortly after graduation. I help produce medications that literally save
            people&#x27;s lives. I felt like I landed my dream job. However, there is no creative outlet in the drug manufacturing process. The pharmaceutical industry is extremely regulated, which leaves little room to implement creative
            improvements.</p>
          <h3 class="h3 follow-up-heading about-padding">That Fateful night</h3>
          <p class="paragraph-text">Everything changed one night in 2017. I was living with one of my long time friends who happens to be a web developer. We enjoyed brainstorming theoretical quirky business ventures together. One idea was to take
            old, worn-out purses and upcycle them. We called it “From Hearse to Purse.” <br></p>
          <p class="paragraph-text next-paragraph">On that fateful night, we thought of an app concept that we believed was our best idea yet. Essentially a long forum scoreboard, the app would allow users to award and deduct points away from their
            friends. We called the app Points - Your Actions Matter. We were certain that this was <em>the </em>app. We purchased a computer and got to work. My roommate developed the back-end code, while I designed front-end mockups. I designed the
            entire UI of the application without any formal training or experience. I worked on branding, logo design, color palettes, and typography. After two years of nights and weekends, a lot of trial and error, and phone calls with Apple, our
            app was approved and made available on the Apple app store. It is not my finest work, but it was the start of a new passion.</p>

          <h3 class="h3 follow-up-heading about-padding">Here We are today</h3>
          <p class="paragraph-text">The experience of designing an app sparked my passion for user-center and process-driven design. I enjoy UX because it merges both of my passions, science and creativity. I get to apply the research skills I
            learned in pharmaceuticals and combine them with my zest for creativity to design solutions to problems. I get to turn a thought into a tangible product with no bounds or restrictions.<br></p>
          <p class="paragraph-text next-paragraph">At the start of my UX design journey, I created designs based on how I thought they should be. I didn&#x27;t consider how the experience would be for the user. I now know that design is more than
            looks. It is about solving problems for the user through an iterative process that requires empathy. I find user experience design so fulfilling because it is an ever evolving game of brainstorming solutions to create the best possible
            product.</p>
          <h3 class="h3 follow-up-heading about-padding">What sets me apart</h3>
          <p class="paragraph-text">I understand the importance of an inclusive internet. My wife works as a disability rights advocate and protects the rights of people with disabilities. One of those rights is an accessible internet. Because of
            her, I understand why it is so important to have an accessible internet and recognize how inaccessible the  internet currently is. She fights every day for the basic rights of people with disabilities and I want to support her crusade to
            make the internet fully accessible. It is my priority to make sure that every design I create is accessible to everyone, regardless of ability. Prioritizing accessibility makes me a better designer.<br></p>
          <p class="paragraph-text next-paragraph">I hope you enjoyed learning a little bit about me. I look forward to getting to know you. Please send me an email and I will respond to you as soon as possible. Cheers!</p><a
